# 10-Day Critical Path Learning Plan for Principal Architect Role

## Overview
This 10-day plan is designed for ~10 hours/day learning with multiple 2–3 hour sessions. It follows a critical path: you will first master core backend, cloud, and AI/ML integration skills, then practice architectural storytelling for interviews.

---

## Legend
- **Critical Path** = Essential for interview success; must complete on time.
- **Extra Reading** = Supplementary knowledge to boost confidence.

---

## Day 1 – Python Refresh & Backend Foundations
**Morning (Critical Path)**: Python OOP, decorators, context managers, typing.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: REST API basics in Flask (build a simple API).  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: Advanced Python tricks for interview Q&A.

---

## Day 2 – Django for APIs
**Morning (Critical Path)**: Django REST Framework – CRUD, serializers, views.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: Authentication in Django REST APIs (JWT).  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: AWS CLI basics + deploy a small Lambda via CLI.

---

## Day 3 – Flask vs Django Microservice
**Morning (Critical Path)**: Compare Django + Flask for microservices; deploy both locally.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: Dockerize both apps (multi-stage builds).  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: Best practices for microservice architecture diagrams.

---

## Day 4 – AI/ML Basics (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
**Morning (Critical Path)**: Train & evaluate a model in scikit-learn.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: TensorFlow & PyTorch basics; run a simple model in each.  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: TensorFlow.js quick hands-on.

---

## Day 5 – AI/ML Deployment
**Morning (Critical Path)**: Save & load models; create REST API endpoints for predictions.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: Deploy model API on AWS Lambda + ECR + Docker.  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: Intro to Kubernetes concepts.

---

## Day 6 – AWS for Backend & AI
**Morning (Critical Path)**: S3, DynamoDB, Redshift – quick project demos.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: IAM roles & security best practices for API hosting.  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: AWS architecture blueprints for AI workloads.

---

## Day 7 – Architecture Case Study 1
**Morning (Critical Path)**: Choose a past project & draft architecture diagram.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: Write a 5-slide architecture story: Problem, Constraints, Solution, Tech Stack, Impact.  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: Practice 15-min presentation of case study.

---

## Day 8 – Architecture Case Study 2
**Morning (Critical Path)**: Second project – diagram + explanation.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: Simulate stakeholder Q&A for both case studies.  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: Read AWS Well-Architected Framework.

---

## Day 9 – Integration Project
**Morning (Critical Path)**: Build an AI-powered microservice with Django backend + model endpoint.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: Deploy full stack on AWS (API Gateway + Lambda).  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: Testing strategies for ML & backend.

---

## Day 10 – Mock Interviews & Review
**Morning (Critical Path)**: AI/ML + backend coding challenge practice.  
**Afternoon (Critical Path)**: Architecture interview simulation.  
**Evening (Extra Reading)**: Review all notes; prepare STAR-format answers.

---

## Final Notes
- Track **Critical Path** completion daily — missing one delays later days.  
- Keep **Extra Reading** optional if time-constrained.  
- Maintain a daily journal of key learnings in `notes/dayX.md`.
