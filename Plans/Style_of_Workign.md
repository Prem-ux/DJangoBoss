1. We’ll follow the Critical Path first
The plan already separates essential steps (Critical Path) from extra reading. This way you’ll:
Hit the job-required skills as fast as possible.
Avoid spending hours on less urgent side-topics until after interviews.
2. You’ll work in Multiple 2–3 hr Sessions
We’ll split each day into morning, afternoon, and evening sessions:
Morning: Core topic (e.g., Django backend basics)
Afternoon: Hands-on coding or deployment practice
Evening: AI/ML integrations or interview prep
3. I’ll act as your step-by-step coach
At the start of each session:
I’ll give you the exact objectives
I’ll point out key concepts to take notes on
I’ll give coding exercises or mini-projects for practice
I’ll connect today’s learning to interview-style questions
4. Extra reading stays optional
The “side lane” in your plan is for:
Polishing up on nice-to-have skills like advanced PyTorch or Kubernetes scaling
Diving into theory after you’ve nailed the practicals
